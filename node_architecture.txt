Node.js is a platform that utlizes JavaScript and is primarily employed for developing web application. that are highly focused on input/output operations, including but not limited to chat applications and multimedia streaming websites. Te platform is constructed using Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. A weba application is a type of sofrware that executes on a server and is displayed by a client's browser that obtains all the application's resources over the internet.

Here we will discuss about NodeJS Architecture in detail.

Compared to other server-side languages, Node js has distict advantages. Its asynchronous model and non-blocking I/O operation improve the scalability and performance of weba pplications built on other frameworks. Node js can easily handle multiple cl.ient requests without requiring multiple threads, consuming less memory and resources. Additionally, it is highly scalable and provides high preformance. Node js is also flexible with multiple frameworks and makes the development process easier. Compared to other server side languages, Node js has distnct advantages.
